# 🤝 SignWave - Smart Hindi Sign Language Recognizatio

Welcome to **SignWave**, a cutting-edge sign language interpreter designed to break communication barriers. This project enables real-time detection of sign language alphabets (A–Z, 1–9) and words in both English and Hindi, with an added feature of 🤖 LLM-based sentence suggestions. Users can form words from detected alphabets and leverage our suite of tools to master Hindi sign language.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed as a 1-year academic project during Semester 5 and 6 by our team. It consists of three main components:

- 🧠 **AlphaBetDetection**: Detects individual sign language alphabets (A–Z) and numbers (1–9) in real-time, trained on a dataset of 1000 images per character.
- 💬 **WordsDetection**: Recognizes 30 basic sign language words and uses an LLM to suggest sentences based on detected words.
- 🌐 **Frontend**: Provides an interactive user interface built with modern web technologies.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔤 **Real-time Alphabet Detection**: Identifies sign language alphabets (A–Z) and numbers (1–9) with support for English and Hindi. Users can form words by combining detected alphabets.
- 🗣️ **Real-time Words Detection**: Recognizes 30 basic sign language words (e.g., "Love", "Thank You") in English and Hindi.
- 🔊 **Voice Icon Support**: Includes voice feedback for detected alphabets, numbers, and words in both English and Hindi.
- 🤖 **LLM-based Sentence Suggestion**: Leverages a language model to suggest sentences in words detection mode, enhancing communication.

## 📂 Dataset Details

### 🔡 Alphabet Detection Dataset:
- Covers A–Z (26 alphabets) and 1–9 (9 numbers)
- Each character has approximately 1000 images for training
- Stored in `AlphaBetDetection/images/Data/` (excluded in `.gitignore` due to large size)

### 🧾 Words Detection Dataset:
  - Contains 30 basic words: `Bye`, `Night`, `Afternoon`, `Morning`, `Eat`, `She`, `He`, `Pray`, `Work`, `Study`, `Truth`, `Small`, `Congratulations`, `Sleep`, `Water`, `Need`, `You`, `I`, `Good`, `Hate`, `Hello`, `Hurts a lot`, `I Love You`, `Love`, `Receive`, `Thank you`, `Call Me`, `Crime`, `Peace`, `Happy`, `Promise`.
  - Stored in `WordsDetection/Data/` (excluded in `.gitignore` due to large size).
